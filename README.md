# Snowman-Meltdown
Snowman Meltdown is a fun and challenging word-guessing game! 
Your snowman is melting, and you must save him by correctly guessing the hidden word—one letter at a time.
This program helps me in my understanding working with git/github.

🎯 How to Play
- Guess the letters of a hidden word.
- Each wrong guess causes the snowman to melt a little.
- Save the snowman by guessing the word before he completely melts!

🚀 Features
- Classic Hangman Gameplay: Easy to pick up, hard to master.
- Interactive Interface: Simple controls to guess letters.
- Snowman Theme: Watch the snowman melt with every wrong guess.
